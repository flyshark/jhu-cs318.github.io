## Course Overview

This course gives an introduction to the basic concepts and core principles
used to structure modern computer operating systems. The goal of the class is to 
explain those concepts and principles that are likely to survive for many years 
to come. The course is a departure point for research in operating and distributed 
systems. Specifically, the course introduces the concepts of processes, concurrency, 
synchronization, scheduling, multiprogramming, memory management, and file systems.

Prerequisites
: 600.120 (Intermediate Programming), 600.211 (Unix Systems Programming), 
600.226 (Data Structures), 600.233 (Computer Systems Fundamentals). This course 
involves significant kernel programming tasks. You should: 1). be comfortable and 
fluent in programming in low-level languages (C and x86 assembly in particular); 
2). have experiences of developing in UNIX environment.

## Organization

This course is organized as a series of lectures taught by the instructors, assigned readings, discussion sections, homework,
projects, and exams. They are complementary to each other, helping you reinforce learning on the core concepts in operating systems. 
Questions on examinations will be based on material covered in class, assigned readings, and projects.

| **Lectures:** | Core material of the course.                                                               |
| **Readings:** | The textbook and supplementary readings provide references to lectures, and are good preparations before class. But they are not a substitute for the lectures. In other words, you should come to class. |
| **Projects:** | Five programming assignments, each completed individually or in groups (of no more than 3). They are essential for you to turn the theories you learned into practices. |
| **Homework:** | Optional homework questions for exam preparation (not to be turned in)                     |
| **Exams:**    | Midterm examination and a final exam                                                       |

## Grading

Your final grade for the course will be based on the following weights:
* **Projects:** 50%
* **Midterm:** 15%
* **Final exam:** 35%

For the programming assignments, there are no partial credits. You must turn in working code.

## Policies

Collaboration
: Unless otherwise noted, all work must be completed individually. 
  Homework assignments (if any) may be discussed, but solutions must 
  be completed individually. Projects may be completed in established 
  groups, and implementation approaches may be discussed across groups, 
  but programming code cannot be shared across groups.
{: .policy .dl-horizontal}

Cheating
: **Don't do it**{: .text-danger}. All students are required to know and adhere to the 
  JHU CS Department [Academic Integrity Code](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-integrity-code) and 
  university policies. Failure to do so will result in serious consequences outlined in the policy.
  Simply stated, do no cheat. The consequences are very high for the time/effort saved.
