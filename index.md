#### Goals and Objectives
{: .sec-header}

This course gives an introduction to the basic concepts used to structure modern 
computer operating systems. The goal of the class is to explain those concepts 
and principles that are likely to survive for many years to come. The course 
is a departure point for research in operating and distributed systems. 
Specifically, the course introduces the concepts of processes, concurrency, 
synchronization, scheduling, multiprogramming, memory management, and file systems.


#### Requirements
{: .sec-header}

You are responsible for the material covered in lecture, as well as the 
assigned readings. Questions on homework assignments (if any) and examinations 
will be based on material covered in class, assigned readings, and projects.

| **Textbook:** | Operating System Concepts, by Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne. 8th Edition, Wiley & Sons.   |
| **Projects:** | Four programming assignments, each completed in groups (of no more than 2) or individually |
| **Homework:** | Optional homework questions for exam preparation (not to be turned in)                     |
| **Exams:**    | Midterm examination and a final exam                                                       |

#### Policies
{: .sec-header}

Collaboration
: Unless otherwise noted, all work must be completed individually. 
  Homework assignments (if any) may be discussed, but solutions must 
  be completed individually. Projects may be completed in established 
  groups, and implementation approaches may be discussed across groups, 
  but programming code cannot be shared across groups.

Cheating
: <span class="text-danger">Don't do it</span>. All students are required to know and adhere to the 
  [Academic Integrity Code](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-integrity-code). Failure to do so 
  will result in serious consequences outlined in the JHU Policy. Simply stated, do no cheat. 
  The consequences are very high for the time/effort saved.
