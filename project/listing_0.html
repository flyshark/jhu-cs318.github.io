<H3>Pintos Source Tree Overview</H3>

<DL COMPACT class="source-listing">
<DT><Q><TT>threads/</TT></Q>
<DD>Source code for the base kernel, which you will modify starting in
project 1.
<P>
</P>
<DT><Q><TT>userprog/</TT></Q>
<DD>Source code for the user program loader, which you will modify
starting with project 2.
<P>

</P>
<DT><Q><TT>vm/</TT></Q>
<DD>An almost empty directory.  You will implement virtual memory here in
project 3.
<P>

</P>
<DT><Q><TT>filesys/</TT></Q>
<DD>Source code for a basic file system.  You will use this file system
starting with project 2, but you will not modify it until project 4.
<P>

</P>
<DT><Q><TT>devices/</TT></Q>
<DD>Source code for I/O device interfacing: keyboard, timer, disk, etc.
You will modify the timer implementation in project 1.  Otherwise
you should have no need to change this code.
<P>

</P>
<DT><Q><TT>lib/</TT></Q>
<DD>An implementation of a subset of the standard C library.  The code in
this directory is compiled into both the Pintos kernel and, starting
from project 2, user programs that run under it.  In both kernel code
and user programs, headers in this directory can be included using the
<CODE>#include &lt;<small>...</small>&gt;</CODE> notation.  You should have little need to
modify this code.
<P>

</P>
<DT><Q><TT>lib/kernel/</TT></Q>
<DD>Parts of the C library that are included only in the Pintos kernel.
This also includes implementations of some data types that you are
free to use in your kernel code: bitmaps, doubly linked lists, and
hash tables.  In the kernel, headers in this
directory can be included using the <CODE>#include &lt;<small>...</small>&gt;</CODE>
notation.
<P>

</P>
<DT><Q><TT>lib/user/</TT></Q>
<DD>Parts of the C library that are included only in Pintos user programs.
In user programs, headers in this directory can be included using the
<CODE>#include &lt;<small>...</small>&gt;</CODE> notation.
<P>

</P>
<DT><Q><TT>tests/</TT></Q>
<DD>Tests for each project.  You can modify this code if it helps you test
your submission, but we will replace it with the originals before we run
the tests.
<P>

</P>
<DT><Q><TT>examples/</TT></Q>
<DD>Example user programs for use starting with project 2.
<P>

</P>
<DT><Q><TT>misc/</TT></Q>
<DD><DT><Q><TT>utils/</TT></Q>
<DD>These files may come in handy if you decide to try working with Pintos
on your own machine.  Otherwise, you can ignore them.
