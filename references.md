OS programming requires looking up documentations of various sorts, e.g., ISA, hardware interfaces, 
compilers, architecture. Often times, the lengthy manual is the only reference that is available. 
Pintos is a small and simple OS. But in doing the projects, you will run into many situations where 
you need to look up some documentation. This course will be one of the few courses where you learn
how to effectively read documentations, and hopefully also how to write better documentations later.

For the listed references, you don't need to go through them from beginning to end (especially these
architecture manuals) unless it's recommended so. But you may find useful information in them from 
time to time.
