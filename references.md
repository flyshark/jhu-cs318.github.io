OS programming requires looking up documentations of various sorts, e.g., ISA, hardware interfaces, 
compilers, architecture. Often times, the lengthy manual is the only reference that is available. 
Pintos is a small and simple OS. But in doing the projects, you will run into many situations where 
you need to look up some documentation. This course will be one of the few courses where you will
be reading a lot of documentations, which hopefully helps you become efficient at it and write better 
documentations later. For the listed references, you don't need to go over them from beginning 
to end at once unless it's recommended so. 

### Pintos

* You should read everything below before attempting any of the projects:
  - [Getting Started](project/pintos_1.html)
  - [Coding Standards](project/pintos_8.html)
  - [Project Documentation](project/pintos_9.html)

* You need not read the reference guide, but you may find the information in it valuable from time to time:
  - [Reference Guide](project/pintos_6.html)

* You'll want to read these once you start work on the projects. Their advice can save you a lot of time:
  - [Debugging Tools](project/pintos_10.html)
  - [Development Tools](project/pintos_11.html)

* Bracketed notations in Pintos source code comments can be looked up in the [Bibliography](project/pintos_13.html).
  The corresponding manual (e.g., ELF specification) will be fount in the link of the Bibliography.

### x86 Emulator

* [QEMU](http://www.qemu.org): a popular, fast CPU emulator and virtualizer.
